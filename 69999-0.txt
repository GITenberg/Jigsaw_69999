TRANSCRIPT

May 27, 2168--The following conversation between the spaceliner
American Beauty and GCA, Spaceport New Dallas, Mars, was recorded
5/14/2168 and played at the official inquiry today:

    KOSTOV: Calling GCA. This is Kostov in American Beauty calling
    GCA New Dallas. Do you read me? Come in, GCA. Over.

    GCA: GCA to American Beauty. You're in the screen. Come in.
    All clear for landing. Over.

    KOSTOV: Check. Coming in. Speed now ten thousand. Over.

    GCA: You are now visible in northern sky. Will have drink
    ready. Over.

    KOSTOV: That you, Ralph?

    GCA: Yeah, Tony. Welcome back. Will you have that with soda
    or on the rocks?

    KOSTOV: Straight, with a blonde chaser, if you don't mind. You
    say you can see me?

    GCA: Like Sirius on a clear night. Only one problem.

    KOSTOV: What's that?

    GCA: You're smack in between me and that girl in Omaha. I
    wish you wouldn't block the view like that.

    KOSTOV: I'll take my hat off. Better?

    GCA: Much. Say, what's that light on your starboard side?

    KOSTOV: Light? There shouldn't be any....

(AN EXPLOSION, FOLLOWED BY SOUND OF ROARING FLAME)

    GCA: Tony! What happened? GCA calling American Beauty!

    JENSEN: Stewardess to pilot! Stewardess to pilot! The starboard
    fuel tank's exploded! Fire in passageway!

    KOSTOV: Activate all extinguishers--clear the passengers forward--I'm
    going to close the emergency bulkheads.

    GCA: My God, it's a ball of fire! Tony, can you make it?

    KOSTOV: I can make anything. If it gets hot enough I'll spit on
    it and put it out--Pilot to naviga-

NOTE: At this point American Beauty's radio went out.

BOARD FINDING: Flippant attitude of ship-to-port conversation to
be deplored. On the basis of this and other evidence, however, the
official finding of this Board is No Negligence. Accident due solely to
mechanical failure.

_STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL:_

Interviewed employee A. Kostov relative to the unfortunate business
of 5/14/68 in which thirty-six passengers and two crewmen lost their
lives. Gave him the news that he is through as a pilot, due to the fact
that we feel the experience has broken his nerve. Offered him a desk
job, which he declined as expected. Accepted his resignation, effective
immediately.

COMMENT: Entire incident most unfortunate. Understand that the Line
might lose passengers to Interplanetary Transport Service if the
American Beauty pilot continued to operate our ships, but regret
this loss of a valuable employee. Of course he will not be taken on
by any other line, but the profession will be the poorer for the
absence of this talented, fearless pilot. On the personal level, hope
that this man of whom all associates were fond will not take out his
understandable bitterness in any violent manner.--A. J. Bannerman,
Director of Personnel

DEATH KNELL OF SPACESHIPS SEEN POSSIBLE

New York, Sept. 12--Speculation was rife in scientific circles this
week over reports that a workable converter-transmitter may soon be
a practical reality. Should this prove true the spaceship, a travel
fixture for two centuries, would soon be obsolete.

The principle of the converter-transmitter, long known to scientific
enthusiasts, is that of television carried a step farther. As
television converts voices and images into electrical impulses and
beams them to a receiving set which reassembles the picture and voice
which started out, solid objects are converted, transmitted and
reassembled by this mechanism.

Clearly, workable converter-transmitters would quickly cause the
spaceship to become outmoded, as they would transmit anything and
everything at the speed of light. The moon could be reached in less
than two seconds, Mars in four minutes.

The great question is whether humans could endure the stress of such
an experience. The current speculation has been caused by rumors
that a leading scientific foundation has secretly started human
experimentation with a converter-transmitter.

12 SEPT., 2168

Concluded interviewing of volunteers. Believe the right man has been
found. Name--Anthony Kostov. Claims to be a former space pilot.
Feel that he is the perfect subject--age 28, physically and morally
tough. Most important, however, he is obviously under a compulsion
to prove his courage, due to some incident in his recent past. This
compulsion should prove helpful in case he learns what happened to
Sartorius--Garski.

REPORT

FROM   : Council Member #7

TO     : The Science Council

SUBJECT: Peiffer Converter-Transmitter

1. Verified rumor that Nicholas Garski, director of experiment, plans
to use human subject again, despite Council ruling after the Sartorius
incident. He admits this intention, defies Council to stop him.

2. Ruled that all activity in connection with this experiment be halted
pending investigation and ruling of the full Council.

3. Strongly urge that:

    a. Garski be permanently restrained from further experimentation
    with the converter-transmitter, as he has proved himself
    irresponsibly reckless.

    b. The machine be impounded, since neither the Foundation nor its
    agent Garski have exhibited restraint in their handling of this
    tremendous force or respect for the edicts of this Council.

    c. That Anthony Kostov, the proposed human subject, be acquainted with
    the facts in the case of Steven Sartorius.

Case History 8739

Name__Sartorius, Steven

Date of Admission__Dec. 18, 2166

Age at Date of Admission__25

Patient was employed by Peiffer Science Foundation as electronic
engineer for six years, following graduation summa cum laude from
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Worked under Dr. Nicholas Garski
on the Peiffer converter-transmitter for the three years immediately
prior to his mental collapse. No evidence of psychiatric disturbance
during these years, in college or in childhood.

On Dec. 15, 2166, Sartorius placed himself in the converter-transmitter
and acted as a human guinea pig in an experiment. Appeared dazed but
unhurt after the experience and was placed in bed. Arose late at night,
however, and returned to the laboratory.

Questioned by a night watchman, he attacked and strangled the man. In
the morning he was found, in excellent spirits, working on the machine.
At his feet was the dead body of the watchman.

Patient cannot be classified as paranoic, as there are no persecution
delusions, nor does he exhibit symptoms of hebephrenia or catatonia. Is
cool, lucid at all times, but totally unable to distinguish right from
wrong. Inclines toward capricious violent outbursts of the most vicious
sort, as above.

Diagnosis: Insane, Unclassified. Dangerous.

Prognosis: Incurable.

Those bumbling amateurs on the Science Council are throwing every
possible roadblock in my path. But they will not stop me. A Council
member inspected the laboratory last week, ordered me to suspend
all operations, even took care that the complete medical dossier on
Sartorius was sent to my volunteer. When the volunteer showed it to
me I freely admitted the accuracy of the record. Told him that if he
were afraid, he could withdraw and I would understand. This brought
him quickly into line. My theory as to his compulsion was evidently
well-founded. As to the suspension of operations, I shall see to it
that it is strictly temporary.--Garski

Mr. Robert Shepard

_Personal_

It is regrettable that your organization has seen fit to interfere with
my work. If it comes to the hearing before the full Council, I suppose
I shall be forced to bring out the facts about some unfortunate medical
experiments at the University forty-two years ago. Of course this might
not bother the august President of the Council. Perhaps he likes to be
reminded of carefree student days....

Dear Ralph:

I may be seeing you sooner than you expect. Maybe you've read the
rumors about converter-transmitter experiments in the facsimile papers.
Well, that's me, baby. I'm the human cannonball that they're going to
shoot through space.

You've heard of the Peiffer Foundation. They turned out that stepped-up
atomic fuel a couple of years ago. Well, they're my new bosses, and an
old bird by the name of Garski is getting ready to load me into his
cannon. And the target is Mars.

So if you hear somebody go shooting by your window one of these nights,
hollering, "Look, Ma--no rocket ship!" that'll be your old buddy.

I'm not exactly crazy about this Garski character--he looks at you like
you were an interesting smear under a microscope--but I'm not getting
paid to love him. I'm getting paid to take a chance, and the money's
good--enough to buy me a tramp ship so I can start my own little line
when this is over.

And speaking of lines, tell our friend Bannerman I'll be glad to hold
him on my lap on the return trip--that is, if he's got the nerve.

See you soon, buddy.

All is in readiness for the final step in the experiment. The volunteer
has signed a waiver of all claims save that of payment, the mechanism
has been triple-checked in test runs with inanimate solids. Tomorrow at
approximately 2:30 p.m. Central Standard Time the Earth will come into
the ideal juxtaposition with Mars. I am confident that the adjustments
I have made in the resistor coils and elsewhere will eliminate all
shock to the subject and success will be mine. But twenty-four hours
from now and a galaxy will echo to the name of--Garski

FINAL REPORT

PROJECT 3889, NICHOLAS GARSKI, DIRECTOR

5 OCT., 2168

(Note: This report made by Laboratory Technician D. J. Williams in the
absence of Dr. Garski, for the record. Complete report will be made by
the Doctor upon his return.)

Project 3889 was today completed. Result: Failure. The subject Kostov
has been found insane and removed under guard. Dr. Garski left the
laboratory in a highly agitated state immediately after the experiment
and has not returned. It might be observed by one who was present at
both experiments that the eyes of the subject Kostov were of the same
lifeless glassiness as those of Sartorius after the first experiment in
'66.

UNIDENTIFIED BODY DISCOVERED

Chicago, Oct. 6--The body of an elderly man was found floating in Lake
Michigan this morning by fishermen. There was no identification on the
body, but the clothing seemed to indicate a hospital or laboratory
worker. Suicide was indicated by an unsigned note in a pocket reading,
"I know now what I have done and it is unthinkable."

       *       *       *       *       *

_The Journal of Steven Sartorius_

Oct. 6, 2168.... There is another nearby like myself. I can feel its
presence. This is great news--the time approaches! Soon I will no
longer have to while away the hours by writing these pages and then
destroying them before the guards come around. For this other must
sense my presence too, and working together, we will quickly escape
this house of madness.

They have put it in the compartment next to mine. That is excellent. I
will communicate with it by wall-taps, and we will soon devise a code.
Once this is done, I will communicate to it my plan for overpowering
the night guard and we will be away from this place.

Away--free--free of these fools who class us with lunatics. And of them
all, Garski was the greatest fool. I hear the guards in the hall saying
he destroyed himself when the second experiment failed.

Failed, he thought! A fool to the end. It succeeded! Just as the first
one did, it succeeded.

An answer so beautifully simple, and he never saw it. Garski the
perfectionist, meticulously checking each last detail. And not seeing
the most important fact of all.

Of course the machine works--up to a point. The body that is assembled
in the receiving set is physically complete. Atoms and molecules can be
converted into electrical impulses and beamed through space, for atoms
and molecules are solids. But a soul is not.

There is more to a man than atoms and molecules, and that is why I am
not a man, although I have a man's body. Thanks to Garski's machine, I
am the first of all time to be free of that foul encumbrance men call a
soul. The chains of conscience struck off, I am free to destroy those
who oppose me, to kill--to conquer!

Yes--conquer. For there will be more of us when we have escaped this
prison. I know how to build the machine. And I hear the guards saying
this other is strong and bold. That is well. What a combination we will
make, I to create the supermen of tomorrow and my new brother to lead
them! A terrible army of soulless creatures to enslave these weaklings
that call themselves men.

Wait! Do I hear a faint tapping? Yes, it is trying to contact me
already. I come, brother, I come...!

To All Staff Members--CONFIDENTIAL

The escape of the inmates Sartorius and Kostov will not be discussed
with members of the press. The salient facts, i. e. vital statistics on
the dead guard Rasmussen, exact time of the escape, etc., have already
been announced by this office and it is felt that further discussion of
the matter would only lead to unnecessary speculation.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
